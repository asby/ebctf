Welcome to this server. 

You'll have to pass three levels of security before you can find
the flag. The goal for level1 and level2 is to get the ssh key for
level2 and level3. The goal for level3 is to get the flag. 



There are some rules you should read before you continue.

Rules:
------
* Behave
* Clean up your mess once done (you don't want to help other teams)
* No fork bombs please
* There is no need to do system wide searches, the challenges can
  be found in the users home dir.
* Not following these rules can get your ip banned from our 
  infrastructure and can lead to disqualification of your team

Have fun and once again, behave.
